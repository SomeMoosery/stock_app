What is Reciprocal Financial?
Reciprocal Financial is a currently in-development financial services solution that provides young adults across America with safe, easy, high-return financial freedom. This financial service provides both an investment with returns far greater than that of a savings account while having risk far less than that of active investments, as well as a means of maintaining short-term, small-amount liquidity. Users can deposit savings into their Reciprocal account and let our team of robo-loaners invest their deposit to yield the highest return, or take out short-term, small-dollar-amount loans from users utilizing Reciprocal as an investments account. Users also can provide individual loans to individual users.

Product & Services:
Why we need Reciprocal Financial: The financial technology industry is advancing rapidly. In the past decade, we have seen the number of fintech companies increase over eight-fold. Yet, most of these companies aim to simply ameliorate the burdens we face when dealing with antiquated aspects of finance. They aim to be bandages over systems that, while they may have been the most effective even a decade ago, are not necessarily optimal now. With the push towards mobile and growing power of machine learning, financial processes that were once necessitated to be centralized by a firm large enough to employ the man power to process and analyze such a bulk of data no longer need to be. The loaning industry is one of these firms. This current system of large, centralized loaning firms is outdated, overly complicated, and unnecessarily rigid. When individuals think of taking out a loan, it is often for major, long-term purchases or investments – a home, a car, or college tuition. Yet, the young adult population of America is growing continuously more financially-savvy, largely due to ever-increasing ease of access to the financial services industry at their fingertips. New methods of investing are constantly surfacing, from robo-investors to zero-commission, gamified trading. New fintech companies have changed the way we think about trading, saving spare change, and planning for retirement. Why has no company changed the way we passively invest? With Reciprocal Financial, we aim to bridge the gap between smarter passive investments and a revolution in the loaning industry. Rather than having a bloated loaning firm with massive amounts of cash loaning out hefty, contract-filled loans to individuals, we can now decentralize this model and allow all loans, and most of the capital, to remain in the hands of our clients. This bridge, powered by both mobile-first implementation and the strength of machine-learning and automation, will allow for a simpler way to both receive loans and earn far more passive interest than with a traditional savings account. By changing the way we view loans, we can provide young adults the financial freedom, in either savings or in short-term loans, that so many desperately crave.

What Reciprocal Financial provides: Reciprocal Financial provides our clients with a full suite of new ways to think about their money. The services Reciprocal Financial provides can be broken down into three main categories: a new savings account, a center for micro personal loans, and a short-term, low-risk, low-return source of income.
1.	A new type of savings account. Savings accounts have been, for far too long, practically useless in terms of receiving any sort of returns. With Reciprocal Financial, you can truly make your savings work for you. Without the volatility of investing in the stock market while maintaining far higher returns than a simple savings account, Reciprocal is the ideal middleman in terms of savings. While a slight increase in risk is faced due to money center for the firm being decentralized into the hands of its clients, the returns gained by taking on this risk is a clear-cut positive. The idea is simple. Our clients deposit whatever they are looking to save in their Reciprocal Financial account. This money then sees its fullest potential with the help of our team of robo-loaners. Simply put, this is an algorithm that maximizes how the client’s funds are loaned out to clients seeking loans to maximize returns based off the loaning client’s interest. So, all the client looking to save must do is deposit funds and let Reciprocal Financial take care of the rest.
2.	The counterpart, the reciprocal, to this high-return, low-risk savings account Reciprocal Financial provides is the capability to take out small-dollar-amount, short-term loans without the hassle of going through a large money center. The world is interconnected and has been for some time now. Yet, for some reason, personal loans have not caught up with the times. To get a loan for something other than a large, long-term payment, an individual still must seek out a friend or family member willing to fork over that amount. A contract is rarely signed. This does not need to be the case. Reciprocal Financial provides clients with the ability to get a personal loan from anywhere in the world, from another vetted, trusted, Reciprocal Financial client. These loans are what keeps the system running. With a predicted large volume of clients taking out these micro personal loans, interest will continuously be flowing into the hands of both the firm and the loaners themselves. 
3.	The last part of Reciprocal Financial is the ability for clients to complete single loans. The client can set their desired loan amount, weeks until repayment, and interest rate, and we will match them with a client looking for a loan of the same, or similar, criteria. This would be a method marketed as a short-term, low-risk, low-reward option for the loaner. 
Target Customers:
Reciprocal’s target customers are primarily those born into the digital age. Individuals who have never quite understood the idea of a strictly physical community but rather the idea that, while they may be in a local branch of a community, there is a global, interconnected community for any interest imaginable. Whether that be through Reddit, Facebook, or OpenTable, these individuals trust their global communities as much, oftentimes more than, their local communities. These customers therefore have a natural inclination to give as much initial trust as possible to Reciprocal Financial. They will embrace the idea that personal loans no longer must be localized, just as taxis services, niche interest groups, or close friend groups are no longer localized. They will see Reciprocal Financial as the disruptive, mindset-changing firm it aims to be with as little skepticism as possible. They will be financially savvy and take full advantage of the wealth of powerful financial tools recently made available to the public. They will be risk-averse, as the emerging ease of access to financial markets has taught them valuable lessons in the dangers of cheaply, oftentimes “free” investing and speculating.
Ultimately, Reciprocal Financial sees its typical user as a high-aspiring young professional no older than thirty years of age, seeking to make the most out of their newly-found financial freedom and relatively high income. This young professional will have the notion of making great sacrifices and putting in a great deal of effort to have achieved their financial status, and therefore will want their net worth to grow as quickly, but as safely as possible, for they are concerned about their net worth ever falling below its current value. 
Competitors:
While initially it may seem that Reciprocal Financial’s primary competitors would be other loaning companies, this is not necessarily the case. Reciprocal Financial is not targeting the typical loans that these firms are giving out. We are not a means to provide college tuition easement or purchase a car or a home. We are a personal loans firm that provides our clients the ability to earn low-risk, high-return passive income off interest. We want to make our clients money work as strongly for them as possible. Therefore, our competitors are firms which operate along similar lines – making their clients’ money work for them. Firms that provide rounding-up to the nearest dollar amount to invest in the market, firms that utilize robo-investors to passively invest in a breadth of areas from real estate to emerging markets, and the like. Our competitors operate on the promise that with their product, users will be able to see their money safely grow at an impressive rate. Whether that be framed as saving for retirement or earning extra cash, this is the goal. 
Marketing:
Reciprocal Financial seeks to directly challenge its competitors, as the investments industry is often a game of decimals. Average risk can be calculated to a precise amount, as well as average return on investments. With Reciprocal Financial, we believe that our clients will receive the best combination of risk and return available to the passive investments industry. While perhaps slightly riskier than simply keeping your money in a savings account, or even an ETF, Reciprocal Financial’s services are far less risky than investing in individual stocks or trading options. While perhaps slightly less rewarding than trading stocks, Reciprocal Financial’s services offer returns far greater than letting savings sit in a savings account. Reciprocal Financial is the middle man that serves as a one-stop-shop for both receiving short-term liquidity, as well as providing a means for passive investments. This continuous circle of clients needing loans and clients providing loans that allows us to live in this middle ground, which in the investments industry is quite a desirable place to be.
